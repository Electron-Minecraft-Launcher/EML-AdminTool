When someone wants to create a Standard account (as opposed to an Administrator account that has all the permissions and chooses the Standard account permissions), the Administrator account receives an account acceptance request and grants certain permissions or not to the account in question.<br>\nIf anyone could create an account, the Administrator would be overwhelmed with requests.The 3-digit Security Code should therefore only be given to Minecraft server staff members of this EML AdminTool.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>How to find and use the 3-digit Security Code? - For the Administrator</h4>\n\n<p>\nThe 3-digit Security Code was randomly generated for you when you configured the EML AdminTool. You can find it on the EML AdminTool Administrator panel.<br>\n<br>\nYou should only give this code to trusted people who will need to use the EML AdminTool. This code will be requested during account creation. Once this is done, you can assign permissions to this new user.<br>\n<br>\nIf the code is leaked and you receive too many regular account creation requests, you can regenerate it on the EML AdminTool management page.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>How to get the 3-digit security code? - For Standard users</h4>\n\n<p>\nYou have to ask the EML AdminTool Administrator for it. He can refuse to give it to you if he thinks that you do not need to access the EML AdminTool.<br>\nHowever, it is essential to know it to be able to register on the EML AdminTool. Be careful ! You are not notified when the 3-digit security code you entered is incorrect!<br>\nOnce you have registered, the Administrator can choose to refuse you or to accept you. In the latter case, he/she may assign certain permissions to you.\n</p>"

If the hashes are different, the file will be re-downloaded. This optimizes the loading time of the Launcher<br>\n<br>\nThe set of files that the Launcher must download is called the <i>ModPack</i>. This should be composed as follows:\n<code class=\"block\">\nconfig/<br>\nmods/<br>\nresourcepacks/<br>\nminecraft.jar<br>\nservers.dat<br>\n</code>\nIn the <i>config</i> folder are the mods configurations files.<br>\nIn the <i>mods</i> folder are the mods that the Launcher should download.<br>\nIn the <i>resourcepacks</i> folder are the texture packs that the Launcher should download for the player.<br>\nThe <i>minecraft.jar</i> file corresponds to Forge or MCP in the correct version. If your Launcher launches Minecraft in Vanilla version, you can leave it out. If your Launcher runs Minecraft with Forge, you need to download the Forge installer for the desired Forge version from <a href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\" target=\"_blank\">this website</a>. Upload <b>this same file</b> to the EML AdminTool! There is no need to run this file before placing it in the ModPack!<br>\nThe <i>servers.dat</i> file is optional. It contains the list of multiplayer servers that will need to be entered in the Multiplayer menu of Minecraft. For more information, please refer to <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Servers.dat_format\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a>.<br>\n<br>\nIf the file(s) you want to upload is/are heavy, expect a loading time.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>Complex use</h4>\n\n<p>\nThe Files Updater option is limited in functionality.<br>\nIf you want to transfer a large amount of files/folders, move items to other directories, ..., it is advisable to use an FTP client such as WinSCP or FileZilla and connect with the credentials found on the panel site management (Plesk, cPanel, ...).<br>\nThe files are located in the <code>/api/files-updater/files/</code> directory.\n</p>"

If not, it automatically downloads the new update. This saves Launcher users from having to visit your site to update their Launcher.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>Use the bootstrap</h4>\n\n<p>\nTo apply a Launcher update, you must go through the Bootstrap option. You will then upload a file for each OS: Windows, macOS and Linux (Debian and Ubuntu). If your Launcher is not compatible with one of these systems, upload a \"random\" file ending with the correct extension (<code>.exe</code>, <code>.app</code> or <code>.deb</code>). Indeed, all fields must be completed.<br>\nYou will also need to indicate the new version. This new version must be superior to the version currently online. For example, if the current version is <code>1.0.3</code>, the new version could be <code>1.0.4</code>, <code>1.1.2</code> or <code >2.2.0</code> (for example).<br>\n<br>\nIf your files are not uploading, they may be too large. By default, the limit indicated on the EML AdminTool is 500 MB, but PHP can also apply a limit. To modify this limit, it is necessary to modify the values <code>post_max_size</code> to <code>1500M</code> and <code>upload_max_size</code> to file <code>500M</code> of the file <code >php.ini</code> (if your host allows it). Otherwise... you're stuck ðŸ˜…...\n</p>"

You can also notify Launcher users of the reason for this maintenance, and schedule an approximate end date.<br>\nPlease note that this end date does not automatically deactivate maintenance, but just informs players of a possible end of maintenance on that date; maintenance must be disabled manually.<br>\n<br>\nIt should also be understood that activating maintenance is not a foolproof way to block access to the Launcher (due to the Launcher license obliging to disclose the source code of the Launcher and therefore to modify it).\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>Update a Launcher in maintenance</h4>\n\n<p>\nOnce maintenance is enabled, you may want to update your Launcher.<br>\n<br>\nIn order to be able to access the Launcher despite the maintenance activated, you must modify a value in the file <code>package.json</code>.<br>\nLocate the following line:\n<code class=\"block\">\n\"bypassMaintenance\": false\n</code>\nChange the value to <code>true</code> like so:\n<code class=\"block\">\n\"bypassMaintenance\": true\n</code>\nMaintenance will no longer affect <b>your</b> Launcher during update testing.<br>\nBefore exporting your Launcher and offering an update, remember to set this value back to <code>false</code>.\n</p>"
